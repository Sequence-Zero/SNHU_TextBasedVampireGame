# SNHU_TextBasedVampireGame
Python text based game which utilizes OOP concepts.

This game establishes a physical location, supported by multiple functions for both printing the instructions, and a message which includes an updated location within the 
game map and a current list of the players inventory. The objective of the game is to navigate through the lair of the vampire, collecting all 6 necessary items into your inventory before
running into the Vampire. If a player runs into the Vampire before all 6 items are collected into their inventory, they lose the game. 
Upon succesfully collecting all 6 items without first encountering the Vampire, they are granted safety and win the game.
